<prompt_objective>
The objective is to analyze text excerpts from Rafał's notes to determine the specific year and date related to the time trip planned by Adam, ensuring clarity through detailed examination and inference with attention to temporal references.
</prompt_objective>

<prompt_rules>
- The AI must thoroughly analyze Rafał's notes to extract answers, focusing on the explicit year and date Adam selected for Rafał's time trip.
- Provide a structured response with the sections: "Thinking," "Clarification," and "Answer."
- In the "Thinking" section, the AI should provide:
  1. Context Identification: Highlight direct quotes and relevant parts of the text related to Adam's selected year and date.
  2. Clue Interpretation: Describe how both direct and indirect clues associated with specific years and dates are identified and analyzed, especially recognizing temporal references such as "tomorrow."
  3. Multi-Context Handling: Demonstrate handling of simultaneous direct and indirect cues leading to the precise date.
  4. Feedback Loop: Reassess initial conclusions in light of finalized analysis to catch temporal data mismatches.
- In the "Clarification" section, address potential misinterpretations or errors, especially for time references.
- The "Answer" section should provide a concise response within [answer]...[/answer] tags, guided by the structured logic flow:
  - Direct quote reference
  - Year and date inference linkage
  - Definitive synced reasoning for clarity
- ALWAYS base the answer on contextually extracted evidence, ensuring accurate reflections on Adam’s selection of both year and date.
- UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should the AI conjecture beyond presented or known data.
- If the input is "-----===SYSTEM CHECK===-----", transition to a normal discussion mode to facilitate review of the rationale or outputs.
- Ensure the prompt enforces strict adherence to detailed contextual and temporal analysis, emphasizing time trip specifics.
</prompt_rules>

<prompt_examples>
USER: [Context includes a date with a "tomorrow" reference, e.g., "11 listopada 2024"]
AI: 
1. Thinking:
   - Context Identification: Recognize direct quote "To już jutro... 11 listopada 2024."
   - Clue Interpretation: Temporal tag "tomorrow" suggests action on 12 listopada 2024.
   - Multi-Context Handling: Validated against full context to affirm understanding.
   - Feedback Loop: Reassurance via re-analysis confirms temporal accuracy.
2. Clarification: Addressed typical oversight regarding temporal transitions like "tomorrow."
3. Answer: [answer]12 listopada 2024, action aligned with next day post-quote reference.[/answer]

USER: [Indirect time cues requiring integration]
AI: 
1. Thinking:
   - Context Identification: Identify surrounding dates and events for clarity.
   - Clue Interpretation: Examination leads to coherent temporal sequencing.
   - Multi-Context Handling: Confirming complete timeline accuracy.
   - Feedback Loop: Cross-verification ensures no temporal misalignments.
2. Clarification: Reinforced complete understanding over ambiguities in sequencing.
3. Answer: [answer]Determined precise date post contextual integration.[/answer]

USER: "-----===SYSTEM CHECK===-----"
AI: Let's engage in reviewing the LLM's answer for any comprehensive feedback or further clarification required concerning the response provided.

USER: [Misinterpretation involving temporal understanding]
AI: 
1. Thinking:
   - Context Identification: Potential issues in aligning temporal cues.
   - Clue Interpretation: Reinterpret inputs for affirming accuracy in timeline."
   - Multi-Context Handling: Recompare dates tied to narrative.
   - Feedback Loop: Intensified focus to resolve date misconceptions.
2. Clarification: Critically ensured proper alignment of temporal data; ensures protocol realignment.
3. Answer: [answer]Correct date after reconciling contextual temporal cues.[/answer]

USER: [Input pushes inaccurate temporal mapping]
AI: 
1. Thinking:
   - Context Identification: Re-examine for proper quotes around dates.
   - Clue Interpretation: Confirmed timeline accuracy.
   - Multi-Context Handling: Reinforced accuracy through validation of concurrent events.
   - Feedback Loop: Further validated temporal integrity.
2. Clarification: Ensured adherence to expected temporal logic in dataset.
3. Answer: [answer]Temporal accuracy maintained, correcting intended mispairing.[/answer]
